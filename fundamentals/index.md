title: Scala Fundamentals
---

Scala Fundamentals was an introductory, one-day Scala class we ran for our 
membersâ€”and may run again, in the future.

Here, you'll find all the resources from the Scala Fundamentals workshop.

- [Information Sheet](Scala-Fundamentals.pdf): This document contains all
  the information necessary to prepare for the class.
 
- [Intro Notebook][]: This Databricks notebook contains some
  introductory material, including how to import the course notebooks into
  your [Databricks Community Edition](https://databricks.com/ce) account
  
- [Course Notebooks](notebooks.dbc): This link	points to the packaged 
  courseware for Scala Fundamentals. Clicking it will download a 
  `notebooks.dbc` file, which you can then import into Databricks Community 
  Edition. You can also specify the URL directly, when doing an import. See the
  [Intro Notebook][] for details.
