# PHASE: Philly Area Scala Enthusiasts

The Philly Area Scala Enthusiasts (PHASE) is a user group for people in the
Philadelphia, PA, region who are interested in the [Scala][] programming
language. If you're interested in Scala, programming on the Java VM, or
functional programming in general, feel free to join us.

PHASE tries to meet monthly. In addition, PHASE is actively involved in
organizing conferences and collaborating with other Philadelphia-area
technology users groups. In the past year, PHASE organized [Scalathon][],
the first international Scala hackathon; in addition, PHASE was one of
three regional Scala user groups behind the [Northeast Scala Symposium][].

For information about our monthly meetings, see the
[PHASE Meetup page][meetup-page].

We're active and we're growing. Join us!

**You'll find links to videos and slides from some previous talks [here](talks.html).**
