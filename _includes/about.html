  About PHASE
</h1>

<p>The Philly Area Scala Enthusiasts (PHASE) is a user group for people in the
Philadelphia, PA, region who are interested in the
<a target="scala-lang.org" href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>
programming language. If you're interested in Scala, programming on the
Java VM, or functional programming in general, feel free to join us.</p>

<p>PHASE tries to meet monthly. In addition, PHASE is actively involved in
organizing conferences and collaborating with other Philadelphia-area
technology users groups. PHASE is one of three regional Scala user groups
behind the
<a target="nescala" href="http://nescala.org">Northeast Scala Symposium</a>.
In past years, PHASE also organized
<a target="scalathon" href="http://scalathon.org/">Scalathon</a>,
the first international Scala hackathon.</p>

<p>For information about our monthly meetings, see the
<a target="meetup" href="http://www.meetup.com/scala-phase">PHASE Meetup page</a>.</p>

<p>We're active, and we're growing. Join us!</p>
