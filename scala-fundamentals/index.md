# Scala Fundamentals Workshop

## October 22, 2016

Here you'll find everything you need, if you're attending the Scala
Fundamentals Workshop.

* [Information Sheet](ScalaFundamentals.pdf): **Read this!** This document
  has _everything_ you need to prepare.

* [Course Notebooks](notebooks.dbc): This link will be active Friday night,
  October 21, and will point to the courseware we're using for the workshop.
  There's no need to download this file, though; we'll do all that at
  the beginning of the workshop.

* [Meetup Event Page](http://www.meetup.com/scala-phase/events/224632640/)
